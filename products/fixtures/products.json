      "description": "Run the game wearing Nike Kids Phantom GT Academy AG football boots in Wolf Grey/Metallic Silver/Black, featuring a grippy texture on the upper for enhanced touch and precision ball-striking.

      Back in 2002, Nike pitted eight formidable trios against each other in the Secret Tournament, as the world’s greatest players threw down to see who would be crowned the kings of the cage. Inspired by the iconic ad campaign, this special edition Phantom GT features an aggressive geometric pattern along with Scorpion branding on the upper and insole.

      With a Generative Texture across the upper of the boot, the Nike Kids Phantom GT Academy AG gives you ultimate control in any situation. Thicker and denser at the instep and toe, the grippy texturing improves your touch when receiving the ball and allows greater precision as you ping a pass to your teammate or fire a shot into the top corner.

      For dribbling, the Phantom GT’s extra grip combines with a synthetic leather construction to give you better feel on the ball and a secure, comfortable fit. Underfoot, a lightweight soleplate with an agility-focused stud configuration provides dynamic traction on artificial grass surfaces.",
