# Design

## Inspiration:

The inspiration for the sports website came from a friend who knows my interest and thought it would be interesting to attempt to complete sports website with mainly football boots being my favourite sport and training gear to go along with it. At first coffee mugs and coffee beans was the website site because it seemed quite unique. As a result, the sports website would have a bigger database and broaden the website a lot more. As a result, it a lot more aspects to it and functionality and items that could be added now and in the future. This website was built for the more direct users/customers who want a variety of football boots on one site and find the gear to accommodate the training items necessary. I believe I could make the website with a very good design and stand out to users. Being very user friendly with the colours I&#39;ve found to use. There are always new items being released and the website can use tools in the future to contact customers about new products to bring them back. The website would also show how purchases on the website can be very easily made by the customer finding there item easily and quickly purchasing the items they wish to buy.

## Font

I decided to search the internet for the most effective and popular font for websites. Normally I would search for fonts that would stand out or suit the web page. My discovery from a few websites providing information was the &quot;Arial is one of the most famous fonts for both online and printed media. What&#39;s more, it is the default font in [**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), a popular online office suite. Many critics say that this sans-serif member is a safe bet for anyone.&quot; As a result, I&#39;ve gone for the font that seems to be the best for websites not too much, bold and effective on webpages. As a result, the font I&#39;ll be using is Arial. Sans serif has also been highly recommended.

Example below.

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/3.png">

## Colours

When searching for colours for the website design I wanted something that was a better contrast for the website and high more impact that would highlight the images. As a result, when searching through the colour designs the &#39;Striking and Simple was the best pick and suit for the website. I checked other sites I used but the visme.co site was the best one to choose from([https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/)). The tones shown on the images from the dark to light colours was a perfect blend for the website and was what was required which was stated in the title of the colour type. With the selection I went for a personal preference when selecting but a colour scheme which was appealing for everyone and the colours would complement each other.

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/4.png">

**But I ended up with: where the green/teal tone and sandstone brown reflected better feel of the pitch. I believe they was more suitable on the website and could test and compliment the site theme a lot better.**

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/5.png">

## Icons

Font awesome has reliable icons available on the website which has been used. This is to make it easier for customer to find what their looking for e.g. basket for products selected and magnifying glass for searching for items. I believe this is the best website to use for icons when required as they are very simple to implement into the website. Below I have added the icons used as they will give the site better navigation indication and interactive icons for users. Its universal and known worldwide what the icons are used for on most websites. Therefore, it is best to keep the website simple and easy to follow as this practice is used on many websites online today. Font awesome is a personal preference but always useful when implementing the icons onto websites.

## Content Section

- The content layout of the website has been set via the device size. Desktop having 4 items tablets large and small have 2-3 and mobiles 1 item for easily scrolling.
- All items are going to be displayed if required but the user can select an item type from the all products dropdown
- The item will be the main focus as this is to stand out to get the customers/users attention to possibly have interest and make a purchase
- This will help with the sales on the website if the content is standing out for users.
- The users can select the item they see when all items are displayed when scrolling or they can search for an item. This will display any items with keywords that the user types. Generic words wont display items
- The user will see the rating of the item, name and price displayed when the item displays from the search and the category selected
- Users can give the item a like or dislike if logged in or change their existing input.

## Home Page Image

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/7.png">

The main homepage image was chosen to represent the site&#39;s purpose of being a place to buy football boots.

**Product Images**

 Images of products were chosen for this site that have clear backgrounds. I made sure the imagery uploaded was clear and not fuzzy and didn&#39;t have shadows to best highlight what the site is selling. This made it easy to have the imagery stand out against a light gray background

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/8.png">

## Product List Layout Considerations

- The product layout of the website has been set via the device size to make the site easy to read and products easier to view:

| DEVICE | NUMBER OF PRODUCTS |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | 4 |
| Tablet Horizontal | 3 |
| Tablet Vertical | 2 |
| Phones | 1 |

- On page load, all items are going to be displayed
- The item&#39;s image will be the main focus to get the customers/users attention to possibly have interest and make a purchase
- Well organized, logical dropdowns allow users to reduce the number of products a user sees.
- A search tool bar will be displayed so users can search with words for products they are interested
- Along with the image, the user will see the rating of the item, name and price displayed when the item displays from the search and the category selected
- Users can click on a product image to see details of the product

## Wireframes

Balsamiq frameworks was perfect for designing the website. Once the idea was there it was just piecing the website together to help see what it could look like. Original method was pen and paper but Balsamiq has the tools necessary to complete the web design. If any changes are implemented then I can discuss the changes from the original idea and show how I&#39;ve improved the design. The designed first draft will have amends and improvements where necessary. This is part of an ongoing improvement idea. This will help when designing making the mods and amends where necessary.

The wireframes created below are in details of each page of the website. There will be some tools showing the admin side but the main focus is the website design. Once the web design pages are working correctly and full functional. The websites will be provided in full and example explained about any changes made to the design if enough time is available. The website images will show evidence of the wireframes compared to the final outlook.

## Features to Improve/Implement

### 1. Interactive Videos of the Items

Users will be able to play videos of people having the items on and seeing what the items look like on people to give them an idea. This is a development on most clothing websites these days. As they have small clips playing on the item once its selected.

### 2. Weekly Newsletter

Weekly newsletter that will send out emails to customers who sign up and inform them of new products every month to keep them interested and making possible site purchases.

### 3. Item Recommendations

When the user logins to the website the they will have a drop-down menu of items recommended for them. This will be an algorithm that will be implemented into the site from past purchases and items viewed.

### 4. Website Theme Swaps

Swapping themes from light to dark. Most mobiles and browser have this these days. Therefore, the website would give a more interactive feel to the users if this was implemented into website.

### 5. Site Review Score

A trust pilot review score to be displayed on the website to provide a review of the website and how customer can see the website and how they feel about this. It will also help with site recommendations.

### 6. Order Confirmation Email

The user gets a confirmation email sent (educational purposes only works if website goes live for official use)

### 7. Comment Workflow

Allow users to add comments but have Admin approve them before users can edit them or see them live. Some users may put bad words in comments or some blogs may start arguments that are counterproductive to cross selling products.

### 8. Delete Comments

Allow comment owners and admins to delete comments without going into Django admin panels.

### 9. Product Reviews & Ratings
Allow users to rate items on 1–5-star scale and write reviews of products. Present aggregated star rating based on real user feedback and allow users to read reviews.

### 10. Enhanced Blog
Update blogs to allow posting of images, linking to products and videos.

### 11. Updated Blogger Profile
For bloggers, add image profile, and bio information that can be associated with a blog to build website trust with customers.

## Scalable and Easy to Maintain Code

### Make Code easier to maintain

Using a block content code including content read for each website main the generic design each and simple to keep everything the same and 100% accurate. This was easy for amending purposes and ensure the design was constant throughout the website.  This enabled the different sites to be created a lot better and more efficiently when required. Its easy to break down the code with comments to ensure the information on the site was correct also and easy to debug code if necessary. Any issues with the code would come from the concept and not the base site block included on each page.

# Technologies and Tools

For the website the following programming languages have been used HTML, CSS, Heroku, Django and JavaScript programming languages and more

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/) – The project required and believed GitHub was the best for storing the projects details and easily be used for remote access when required.
-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - used to simplify some DOM manipulation for certain functions
-   [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) – Great tool to be sued for the development of the website and using the platform to complete the website as required. This helped fulfil the potential to complete the website.
-   [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) – Launch the application code via Heroku used via deployment

-  Great website for building and piecing together websites together. Every tool you need.

-  Used to provide unique logo for the web page icon section

-  Used for wireframe creation using professional tools to support the design

-  Audit you used it for your accessibility testing

-  HTML5 - Used as the main language for the templates

-  CSS3 - Used for styling the webpage

-  JavaScript - Used mostly for DOM manipulation upon user interaction

-  Python - Used for the backend of data manipulation high-level and general-purpose programming language

-  Django - high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design

-  Django-aullauth - Django authentication tool

-  Django Crispy Forms – Useable forms for use in Django available

-  Coverage- Used to calculate code coverage of python unit tests.

-  Jinja2 - templating language for Python developers. It was made after Django's template. It is used to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP request.

-  Pillow - Python imaging library to support opening, manipulating, and saving images.

-  Psycopg2- most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. Its main features are the complete implementation of the Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety

-  AWS S3 - Used to store static files within the server

-  Gunicorn - Python WSGI HTTP Server

-  Boto3 - Used to configure and manage s3 buckets

-  Payment system online for completing software accepts payments and manage their businesses online.

-  To handle version control.

-  Used for various of fonts for websites.

-  Providing icons for websites e.g. baskets icons

-  To test responsiveness & functionality on various browsers.

## Data Infrastructure

### Database Choice  

The website required using an easily accessible database to store the information when being obtained for users on the website. E.g. boots and gear. As a result, MySQL was the best solution for completing the project in the best manner. As a result, this would help users with admin credentials add more products required and the website would update with new products instantly.

As a result a entity relational diagram has been provided to show the relationship between the various tables and how they connect. Using key to connect the tables together and make the access and connections for the website accurate and reliable. This also stores the information about each of the products available and where they relate to on the website. The categories make it easy to group items together this can be anything from men’s football boots to kids gear on the website.

The products relate to their own category correctly if the user only wants a particular item such as items in price order. The information of users is also provided making it unique for the user experience and not sharing emails or logins with others. This will prevent anyone using the same emails and passwords to login. The email has to be assigned to one user. Anyone tries to use the same email the user will be notified its being used.  The user information will also store the user details on the system e.g., name, address. This will also include the users order history if they require it or the website owners need to collate information on popular items.

The users in the future will be able to complete blogs on items at the moment it will be only provided to sports celebrities who use the website until the feature is implemented. The blog will store the user’s opinion and experience of a particular item. This will be useful for other readers when deciding on the product. The users can also add reviews of items with a brief comment how they feel about the item. This will be useful for others users with a rating at the end to justify their comment and help others.

The order information will provide details of the users order history and store the information in the records for reference if required. This will be helpful if any users have any problems with the products bought. This will be a feedback feature in future reference. At this current moment they will be using email format until this is set up.

Below is a diagram of the entity relational diagram information provided above explaining the use of the ERD and how it supports the website.

### ERD

Below is a diagram of the entity relational diagram information provided above explaining the use of the ERD and how it supports the website.

### Data Models

Several Data models were used to create this website. Django authorization and All Auth data models are not discussed in this section as they were not developed by me.

#### BLOG_POST

A blogpost will store the “celebrity blogger’s opinion and experience of a particular item. This will be useful for other readers when deciding on the product.

-   Title – required, max length 200 char field
-   Slug – auto created slug field, max length 200
-   Author – Foreign Key Field to user ID
-   Update on – Auto created Date Time Field
-   Content – required, Text Field
-   Status -Integer field to determine if blog is shared or not (defaulted to 1 to share)

#### COMMENT

A comment will store a user’s opinion about a blog post.

-   post – Foreign Key Field to blog id
-   name – required, max length 255, Char Field
-   body – required, Text field
-   date – Auto created Date Time Field
-   comment owner – Foreign Key to user id (admin if made anonymously)

#### CHECKOUT_ORDER

A checkout order holds all the data for a given order. I used the model from the boutique ado example project.

#### CHECKOUT_ORDERLINEITEM

A checkout line item represents one specific product ordered with its size, quantity, total and a reference to the order and product. I used the model from the boutique ado example.

#### PRODUCTS_CATEGORY

This data model is used to make sorting and grouping of products easier. I used the model from the boutique ado example. In the future I would update it so that the name is unique to the system as that caused me trouble when I entered the same category twice by accident.

#### PRODUCTS_PRODUCT

This data model is used to store a given product along with a sku, name, description, price, rating, image, has sizes and category-field. I used the model from the boutique ado example.

# Testing

## Validation Testing

I used the following websites and pasted my code into it to ensure the code had no syntax errors. I believe the sites below help me ensure the code is in a good set up and working correctly including the functionality of the website:

- **JavaScript -** [**https://jshint.com/**](https://jshint.com/)
- **HTML -** [**https://validator.w3.org/**](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS -** [**https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **Lighthouse -** [**https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools)

## User Stories Testing

### Automated

Jasmine testing would be ideal in testing the book website. As we have tested during the end process of the website and nearing the end of the requirement timescale the action cannot be completed. Due to time constraints and working on the other aspects of the game I couldn’t pursue the possible requirement.

### Manual

Manual testing was completed on the website. This included various website test for every functionality and usage. From clicking items to completing full check outs on the website. A table has been put together of the actions testing in regards to the user stories also. Trying to ensure sure user requirements were met and general site functionality.

### Testing Client Stories from UX Section

Manually testing was completed to ensure the website met the user/ user stories requirements. This would ensure the website has been checked and satisfies the users. This including what they want the website to do and how they want it to work. This also included a website with good visibility for the user and not too difficult to read for all users.

### Cross Browser Testing

Multiple web browsers were tested from desktop version to mobile devices. This is to ensure the website has been tested on various devices and functions and displays correctly. Testing will ensure the website is suitable and the website has been checked in the correct manner. It is important to check the functionality in case any CSS amendments are required as they layout needs to be suitable for users. A list of actions required to be available for the website have been provided below.

-   to find items via searching keywords
-   to find items by selecting dropdown lists
-   to be able to view product details
-   to be able to add the products to the basket by clicking a button
-   to be able to decide the quantity of the item to be added
-   to register for the website
-   to login to the website with registered credentials
-   to be able to checkout with ease using user details e.g. name address etc.
-   to be able to amend the basket items
-   to be able to remove items from the basket
-   to return to the products page before finalising the order
-   to have an email confirmation of the order being completed (educational/display purposes)
-   Notification the order has been completed
-   To be able to review order history
-   to be able to use the website name as a home button
-   to be able to amend the admin settings such as products as a super user
-   to have the ability to add products from the website
-   to have the ability to remove products
-   to have the ability to edit products
-   to navigate through the web page with ease

**Note** - Safari has been used this time to test the website there was no access but have someone test the functions for me who said they worked correctly unfortunately this was asked for support. As a result, the evidence provided stated this was completed as needed.

### Device Testing

To enable all device were tested and various device were explored tablets and mobiles were considered to test the game on. This would ensure this works on multiple devices.

## Lighthouse Audit

“Identify and fix common problems that affect your sites performance, accessibility, and user experience.”

Accessibility testing was conducted on the site to ensure it was suitable and performing to a suitable score for users and their experience on the website. This way the site can potentially work to its maximum performance. This is completed by selected the lighthouse option on the developer tool and generating a report for the selected device. This can be mobile or desktop devices.

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/70.png">

The result for mobile was 78 on the early report review since the images are rendering on the website. As the mobile is the main function the improvements will be required. The mobile is the main function and required to be working correctly and too a high standard. This will be excellent in reviewing the progress on the mobile view of the website.

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/71.png">

The results for desktop are 99 for the run of the website while the images have loaded there is still some work in reviewing and checking the code of the website. As this is a early lighthouse review I would like to see the difference with the changes made in the fixing throughout the website. This is for purposes to show the improvements made from what the review is.

 <img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/72.png">

The website has been tested with the lighthouse function mentioned earlier and the new results show an improvement to the website functionality. The website was very poor at the start for the result as I believe the performance was at a good standard but the other site mechanics were too low. As a result, some improvements were made to the desktop and mobile display on the website and the results have improved there’s still room for improvement but its improved which is always a benefit. I believe the accessibility is due to the contrast of colours but suing various websites to find colour schemes I believe it’s better display than portrayed. Nevertheless, the function mentioned in improvements would be a dark and light mode that could be input to make the site accessibility improved.  The website presented has a clean feel for users and it’s not too difficult to navigate and use the website features.

Mobile Accessibility Improvement

## Bugs Discovered

A list of bugs discovered have been provided and some of the additional issues face during the website build. NOtes the errors of the bugs and first implemented to get past the issue.

<img src="https://github.com/tomod24/get_booted/blob/master/media/76.png">  

**Outstanding Defects**

**Stripe**

Stripe disabled the webhooks temporarily on the website for unknown reasons but stated the system wasn’t being used. This maybe because its not live. If there any issues please let me know so I can reenable the system I have raised a ticket and enabled it manually.

**Galaxy Fold**

The galaxy fold is the only device with display issues. I believe it is due to the type of phone because every other device is working correctly with the website. This may be required to be research further as to the display matters.

**Date and Time Display**

When checking out on the mobile the format of the time and date of the order isnt exactly how it should be it needs to fit the screen perfectly for viewing purposes but the alignment is off. This needs to be review for the best posisble format to be displayed. 

All the above are working progress isuses but have been identified to be fixed and amended as required for the functionality of the website.

## Acknowledgements

-   I would like to thank Anthony Ngene who stuck by me from when I needed a guide and help to keep me motivated and see the end goal. He’s been a great help to me making sure am ok and challenged me every step to keep me thinking and learning. I wouldn’t have kept going if it weren’t for him.

-   Tim Nelson and Code Institute for the template created during the course which helped to get me going with the work required.

-   I would like to thank Malia Havlicek not only helps me keeps me laughing and coding fun but now I can class as a friend.  Malia made coding fun for me and said its about getting past the obstacle instead of around. Always ask how things are and we have good confirmations about general coding, working life and home life. This person is a great help to me kept me going. I appreciate all the help I’ve received.

-   For my friends and family who encouraged me to keep going and don’t forget your nearly there.

-   Lastly the tutors I have bothered them give them headaches and not let them 5 minutes peace when I’ve had issues all of them really helped me and had me thinking and figure out issues together. Whenever I needed help, they were there and they deserve praise just as much as the people. Without the guidance I could have been stuck and not made as much progress as I had liked. So Thank you for your time and patience helping me.
